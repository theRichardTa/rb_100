# split and return every individual character

alphabet = 'abcdefghjklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

puts alphabet.split(//)

# I know puts on an array will return every value in a new lines
# also .split(//) parametered accordingly will segment every individual character
# also ('') and ("") would've worked apparently

# also exists #chars which will actually split by characters itself
